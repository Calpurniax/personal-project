# SofÃ­a Gracia - Personal project

Hi everyone! this is a personal project I want to create, because I think it can be useful and I can consolidate what I've learnt, hope you like it!

> **First things first:** You need to have [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/) installed to run this project

### Steps to enjoy this lovely code I made:

1. Better **download** it than using git clone.
2. **Install dependencies** by typing the following in a terminal:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Run the project! with:

```bash
npm start
```

## About the project

I wanted a site to help people with vegetable gardens, so everybody can learn about plants and timing to seed/gather. Im using React and SQLite

### thank you and have fun!
